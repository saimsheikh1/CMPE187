#Assignment Description:
#Gumball Vending Machine
# Design a Gumball Vending machine with the following specifications.
# Machine has two types of gumballs : Red and Yellow. Red ones are worth a nickel and Yellow ones a dime.
# Customer can insert only nickel, dimes or quarters as valid currency. Anything other than that is returned on the push of the dispenses lever.
# There are two levers Red and Yellow to dispense respective type of gumballs.
# Customer can insert multiple coins until he chooses to hit on the dispenser lever.
# Machine vends a single gumball at a time. 
# Customer can enter a quarter, choose to dispense two Red gumballs( by hitting the red gumball dispenser lever twice) and hit a "Return My Change" lever to receive the 15 cents in return.
# **Assume the machine holds unlimited gumballs and unlimited change of currency to return.
